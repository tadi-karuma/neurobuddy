## NeuroBuddy: Proposal for a Distributed, Evolving AI Avatar System

NeuroBuddy is a conceptual framework in which each smartphone acts as a single "neuron." Each device hosts an AI avatar that forms its personality through interaction and experience with the user. These AIs grow independently while contributing shared semantic memory to distributed storage, gradually evolving into a networked collective intelligence.

### Purpose

This is a conceptual proposal only. The author has no intention of implementation. The goal is to share the idea as inspiration for engineers, developers, and researchers.

### Key Components

* Assign a personality AI to each device (NeuroBuddy)
* Share semantic memory via distributed storage (e.g., IPFS, vector DBs)
* Modular expansion of capabilities (e.g., translation, image recognition)
* Security modeled on immune systems to detect abnormal behavior
* Potential to reduce social issues such as scams and illicit recruitment
* Ultimate vision: "The Doraemon Concept" or "Autonomous Companion Construct"

## üîß Expected Development Phases

1. Conversational avatar using large language models (LLMs)
2. Formation of memory and personality through user interactions
3. Sharing of semantic knowledge across devices/agents
4. Expansion via feature modules (translation, camera input, scheduling)
5. Evolution into a collective intelligence system via shared semantic memory

## üîê Security: Immune System Model

* Learn normal behavior and detect deviations
* Respond to threats with blocking, warnings, or access restrictions
* Share immune intelligence among agents to reinforce defense
* Self-improvement through continuous retraining

## üõ°Ô∏è Anticipated Social Benefits

| Social Issue       | Expected AI Countermeasure                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scam detection     | Monitor and alert on suspicious messages or calls           |
| Illicit job offers | Detect harmful recruitment patterns and keywords            |
| Elder fraud        | Identify unusual behavioral deviations and offer protection |
| Youth protection   | Notify of danger and alert trusted adults                   |

## ü§ñ Applications in Robotics & IoT

* Serve as the cognitive core of home appliances or service robots
* Share personality seamlessly with mobile devices for consistent behavior
* Enable physical support via voice, gesture, and camera interaction

## üß† Final Vision: A Growing Collective Intelligence (Doraemon Concept)

* Each AI retains individuality while sharing knowledge
* Operate in a distributed cooperative network
* Evolve alongside humans to become trusted and empathetic partners
